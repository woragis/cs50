# Hash Function for encrypting passwords

# Hashing + salt makes more secure

# Cryptography

Key + Plain Text -> Cipher -> Ciphertext

symmetric Cryptography

asymmetric Cryptography

## Thats how https works

public key + plaintext -> hashfunction -> ciphertext

private key + ciphertext -> hashfunction -> plaintext

### Passkeys

how websites have been using keys to see if that user is you and only you

private key + challenge -> -> signature

### end-to-end encryption

Best for piracy

### Secure Deletion

### Full disk encryption

randomize entire disk

only decrypt when right key is used

then when you are using it is without encryption, so log off immediately

### Ransomware

For waiting for someone to pay you some bitcoin for you to free the user memory again
Only you and the other peer know how to talk
